# Batmans utility charger
If batman ever needed a portable charger just incase to charge his phone, or the batwing, or the batmobile... Well I made it. This portable is rechargable with a OLED screen displaying battery percentage. With a on and off switch plus a button to switch text or animation on the OLED.

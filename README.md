# Batmans utility charger
If batman ever needed a portable charger just incase to charge his phone, or the batwing, or the batmobile... Well I made it. This portable is rechargable with a OLED screen displaying battery percentage. With a on and off switch plus a button to switch text or animation on the OLED. <br/>

The reason why I made this project is because I don't have a good portable charger and wanted to see what I make could compare and be better. The reason for batman is because I like superheros and I think this would be something that batman would have on him for no reason.

Using screws I plan to use them to keep the whole case together

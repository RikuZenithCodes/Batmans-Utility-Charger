# Total Time spent 12h
# July 26th (Start)
I came up with the general idea of what I wanted to do. So I started to select what modules I would want and how I could try and polish this idea. After about 2 hours of researching parts I finally compiled the list that I needed. <br/>

I then started wiring. I had to do extensive research about battery management becuase one of the polishes I decided to do was a OLED that displays battery percentage and this required a voltage divider that I did not know how to wire. (hopefully I got it right)

TOTAL TIME SPENT: 5 hours

# July 27th (CODE)
Once I got the wiring diagram finished I started the code. For now I got mostly example code because for the animations it would be easier to have it in person because I can't simulate the program. I also did not know how to code the battery percentage. So I had to research that. I came up with example code that will hopefully work and then I need to adjust the code according to the parts when wired in person.
TOTAL TIME SPENT: 4 hours

# July 29th (CAD)
Now moving on to the cad of this project it was surprisingly difficult to find the sizing of the parts that were needing a hole for the case of my project. I focused on finishing the case then I added my own little neat touches to it in order to give it the batman look.
